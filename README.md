## Introduction

_An autonomous car is a vehicle capable of sensing its environment and operating without human involvement, and with the technological development it became a reality. In our work, we aim to design and build a car that is capable of moving by itself and take right decisions, moreover, we expand this work to avoid obstacles, this can be done by using an integrated system that is composed of two controllers, one of them is used as the main controller (Raspberry pi Model B) that receives information and processes it in order to make decisions and send them as commands to Arduino controller which is responsible for sending signals that satisfy the commands._
